Installation
============

### Prerequisites
- A basic server to spin up
  - I use [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)
    - You'll need node.js and npm installed to use.
    - `npm install -g http-server`

### Installing and running
- Clone the repo and `cd` into the directory
- Start up the server (if using http-server, just run `http-server` from the root directory)
